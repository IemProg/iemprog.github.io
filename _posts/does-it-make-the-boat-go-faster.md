In my previous article, "Understanding the Cause-and-Effect Timeframes: The Delayed Gratification Advantage", we explored the powerful connection between our actions and their long-term consequences. We often focus on the immediate, the quick fix, the instant reward. But, real returns, the kind that leaves a lasting impact, isn't built on fleeting wins. It's about understanding that the results we see today are often the culmination of actions taken long ago. You can read the full article [here](https://imadmarouf.substack.com/p/understanding-the-cause-and-effect).

This leads us to a key concept, one that builds on this idea of long-term impact: Prioritizing for speed, not just maintenance.

Think of your business, your career, or even your personal goals as a boat. We all tend to get caught up in the day-to-day maintenance of keeping things afloat, ensuring everything is running smoothly. But, the question that truly matters is: Will it make the boat go faster?

Olympic champion Ben Hunt-Davis asks this very question in his book "Will it make the boat go faster?". He emphasizes that, like a rower focused on winning, we need to ruthlessly prioritize tasks that have a high impact on the outcome, rather than simply staying busy.

This concept is a powerful reminder that true progress requires a shift in perspective. We need to move beyond the trap of constant busyness and focus on the actions that will propel us toward our goals.

The rest of this article will explore this "speed-focused" approach in detail, providing concrete examples and actionable strategies to help you prioritize for impact and achieve faster results. Let's dive in!

Here's the thing: We all get caught up in the daily grind. Emails pile up, meetings take over our days, and we're left feeling like we're running on a hamster wheel. But are we actually making progress, or just staying busy?

Hunt-Davis, an Olympic champion, asks this very question in his book "Will it make the boat go faster?" He emphasizes that in any pursuit, whether it's rowing or running a business, we need to focus on tasks that have a real impact on the outcome.

Here's a simple way to think about it: imagine your business is a boat. Maintenance tasks are like keeping the boat clean and in good condition. While they're important, they won't actually make it go faster. The tasks that do make the boat go faster are those that directly impact your performance and results.

Think about it this way:

Cleaning your email inbox: Feels productive, but doesn't move the needle.

Attending a webinar on productivity hacks: Could be helpful, but not a guarantee of success.

Developing a killer sales funnel: Directly impacts your conversion rates and revenue.

Streamlining your accounting and cash flow: Essential for your business's financial health and growth.

So how can you differentiate between these two types of tasks? Hunt-Davis suggests a three-pronged approach:

Seek to eliminate: If a task isn't crucial to your success, eliminate it. This might feel counterintuitive, as it often means saying "no" to requests and tasks that don't directly contribute to your goals. But remember, it's better to focus your energy on what matters most than to spread yourself thin.

Seek to automate: If a task is repetitive and doesn't require your unique skills, automate it. This could involve using software for email marketing, online scheduling, or basic bookkeeping tasks.

Delegate the rest: For tasks that can't be eliminated or automated, delegate to others. This means building a strong team that can handle the essential functions while you focus on strategy and growth.

The real key to achieving your goals is not busyness, but laser-focus. This means prioritizing tasks that have a direct impact on your goals. You'll feel more focused, energized, and ultimately, more successful.

Here are some real-world examples to inspire you:

A young entrepreneur decided to eliminate phone support entirely. They were spending hours each day fielding calls that often took away from their core business activities. Instead, they invested in building a robust email support system.

The result? They freed up valuable time and energy, allowing them to focus on product development and customer acquisition. Their customer satisfaction levels also improved, as they were able to provide a more consistent and personalized email response.

A team of marketing professionals found that they were spending a huge amount of time each week managing their social media accounts. They realized that automating their posts with scheduling tools would free them up to create more engaging and valuable content.

This allowed them to focus on running strategic advertising campaigns and crafting compelling stories that resonated with their target audience.

Don't get stuck in the routines of task achievement. Always assess the importance of your tasks, and whether they help the boat move faster or not. By prioritizing for speed, you'll be able to make significant progress and leave a lasting impact.

So, ask yourself, "Will it make the boat go faster?" And start focusing on the tasks that will propel you toward your goals.
