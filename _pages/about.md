I am a PhD student at the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr), specializing in the continual learning of deep learning models and parameter-efficient training methods. Under the supervision of [Dr. Stéphane Lathuilière](http://stelat.eu/) and [Dr. Enzo Tartaglione](https://enzotarta.github.io/) at the LTCI Laboratory, [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), my research delves into the development of efficient training approaches for large models and the application of continual learning principles to vision-language models.

Previously, I interned at the Computer Vision Center in Barcelona, working on continual learning for vision-language models under the supervision of [Pr. Joost Van de Weijer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gsw2iUEAAAAJ&hl=en). I hold a Master's degree in Data & AI from [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr) and an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Electronics from [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

I am actively seeking research internship opportunities in **vision-language models**, **continual learning**, or **generative models** for the year 2025. Feel free to contact me for collaboration or any research opportunities.
