I am a PhD student at Télécom-Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, working on Machine Learning and Continual Learning. My research focuses on developing methods that enable neural networks to continuously learn new tasks while preserving knowledge of previously learned tasks.

My current work explores continual learning in computer vision and natural language processing, with particular interest in test-time adaptation and memory-efficient learning strategies. I have published papers at top-tier conferences including ICCV and CoLLAs.

I completed a research internship at the Computer Vision Center (CVC) Lab in Barcelona, Spain, under the supervision of Prof. Joost van de Weijer, where I worked on continual visual question answering and class-incremental learning.
