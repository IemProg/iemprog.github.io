I am a PhD student at the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr), focusing on Continual Learning and Deep Learning within the Computer Vision domain. My research is supervised by [Dr. Stéphane Lathuilière](http://stelat.eu/) and Dr. Enver Sangineto at the LTCI Laboratory, [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/). I am particularly interested in developing parameter-efficient training methods for large models, and continual learning techniques for vision-language models.

Previously, I interned at the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es/) in Barcelona, working on continual learning for Visual Question Answering models under the supervision of [Pr. Joost Van de Weijer](http://www.cvc.uab.es/people/joost/). I hold a Master's degree in Data & AI from [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr) and an undergraduate degree in Electronics from [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

My primary research interests are **continual learning** and **multi-modal models**, particularly vision-language models, aiming to explore scalable techniques for model adaptation with minimal fine-tuning, enabling their application in real-world, dynamic environments.
